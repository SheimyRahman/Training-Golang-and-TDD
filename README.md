# Training-Golang-and-TDD
A basic FizzBuzz for learning TDD, written in Go

## Description
This is a basic program called FizzBuzz that prints interger numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. This is a good program, in my opinion, to training TDD.

The entire process is available on this link: https://medium.com/@sheimyrahman/golang-go-e-tdd-para-iniciantes-2418b6eadd92

For now, in Portuguese BR but soon as I can, I will translate to English.
